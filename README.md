# matplotlib-challenge

In this repository, you will find the Pymaceuticals folder, which contains the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb notebook,
the main.ipynb notebook (which contains all of my work and results in 20 cells), and the data folder, which features
two spreadsheets--Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv, two csv files which were merged into a dataframe for the
assignment.

On a separate note, I want to thank Eli, Mark, and Paveen as well as two very helpful AskBCS aids who I consulted to
complete this assignment.

To the grader: Thank you for your time and if there are any errors with my work that would cost me points or errors 
with submission, please let me know. The analysis section of my work is short, but the grading rubric did not seem
to indicate guidelines for it.
